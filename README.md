# Demonstration of my CSS Knowledge

I cloned a template design by HTML5UP using my own CSS to resemble the features of the original.

## Highlights

- Hidden heading titles for screen readers
- Font-awesome icons
- Odd/Even CSS selectors for alternating left/right floats
- Multiple media queries to change many aspects of the responsiveness
- Stacked icons and text at mobile viewport sizes
- Buttons stack at full-width in mobile viewport sizes, and side by side at larger sizes.
- Button hover has a slight opacity change and 0.2s transition time
- clearfix to prevent header collapsing due to the floated phone
- Phone image made entirely with CSS
